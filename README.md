### Ableton Live

#### Packing Projects into Packs
Live’s File Manager provides the option of packing a Live Project in Pack format for convenient archiving and transfer. 

To do this, choose the Manage Files command from the File menu, click the Manage Project button, and then click on the triangular-shaped fold button next to “Packing.“ 

Click the Create Pack button to bring up a file-select dialog where you can specify the name and location of a new Pack file. 

Creating a new Pack from a Project does not affect the Project. If you want the Project deleted, you can delete it using the browser.

Live employs lossless compression techniques to minimize the file size of Packs. Depending on the audio materials in a Project, this saves up to 50 percent in file size.

To unpack a Pack (i.e., to restore the original Live Project), double-click the Pack file (.alp), drag it into the Live main window, or locate it via the File menu’s Install Pack command.
